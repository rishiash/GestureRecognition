## General Information
- Built a 3D Conv model that will be able to predict the 5 gestures correctly.
- The model uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Training and validate accuracies have been documented.
- Few experiments were conducted with the parameters like batch size, number of frames, image size, number of convolution layers. The results of each experiment have been documented in the write-up.
